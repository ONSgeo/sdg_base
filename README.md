This repository houses the base class for SDG projects, calculations of individual SDGs are done in other repositories that inherit from this one. 

See below for set up details:

to set up submodule go to the sdg_x_x_x_src folder (e.g. sdg_11_3_1_src) in git bash. Run the following command
git submodule add https://github.com/ONSgeo/sdg_base.git

this adds the submodule to the sdg project that you're developing
